# Godot-Menu-Template

This project has been created for Godot Engine 3.4 and above.
Its main purpose is to offer common tools and features to create better user interfaces with all the "good practices" of the industry. It's not a universal interface, since all projects have different goals, designs and feelings, you will need to edit it to meet your needs.

The template gives

- A navigation system with transitions
- A UI navigation system based on the keyboard/gamepad layout
- All commons fields
  - Slider: for all int or float values
  - Checkbox: for boolean
  - Hlist: a horizontal list to choose between different options
  - Dropdown: A dropdown list with or without a user confirmation for action that impacts the visual
- Autosave feature
- Keyboard and mouse rebind
- Gamepad support and rebind
- Config manager
- An event bus system
- Sound system where all UI sound can be managed
- Reset to default feature
